**𝐀𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 :**
This dashboard was developed to help organizations assess their progress in diversity and inclusion initiatives by presenting key performance indicators (KPIs) related to hiring, promotion, and turnover. I'm proud to have created a tool that can make a positive impact on workplaces and communities. By tracking KPIs for performance, turnover, hiring, promotion, and gender diversity, this dashboard can help Human Resources measure progress towards improving gender balance at the executive level.HR can identify specific departments or teams that may require additional attention and resources to improve gender diversity. The dashboard can also enhance transparency within the organization.
